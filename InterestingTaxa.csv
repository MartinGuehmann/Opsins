#
# This is a list of interesting taxa.
# The taxa are visualized in the output trees with the given colors
# The format is one taxon per line and a ETE color definition
# The taxon and the color are separated by a tab.
# The taxa should not be part of the same lineage, the behavior is undefined if they are.
# The taxa must start with a capital letter, otherwise they are not recognized, however
# the taxa in the sequence IDs can be in any case, but must be spelt correctly,
# but that would be a problem at NCBI or Swissprot.
# Lines starting with # are comment lines, note the # must be the first character in the line.
