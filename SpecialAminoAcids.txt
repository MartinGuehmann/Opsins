# This is a config files it is loaded by 12_ConvertTressToFigures.py.
# The values defined here are used for displaying the amino acid of
# interest in the visualized trees, and the sequences logos.
# One sequence  logo displays the coveres the sequences around the
# aaPos, toLowerLimit gives the number of amino acids before the
# amino acid of interest at aaPos. And toUpperLimit gives the number of amino acids
# following aaPos for the end of the sequence logo.
# seqFile is the sequence file of the reference sequence, which is the first sequence
# in that file.
# interestingAAsPos are the positions of interesting amino acid positions in
# the reference sequence for another sequence logo.
# Of course, the positions should exist in the sequence of interests. For errors
# here is the user responsible.
