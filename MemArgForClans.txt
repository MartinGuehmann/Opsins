# Memory size argument for CLANS
# This is the maximum memory allowed for CLANS to use
# This is given to the java runtime. Java wastes not only
# memory due to its pointer requirement for objects
# but allocates also new memory before it frees unused
# memory. Therefore this should not exceed the memory
# available on the computer. Note the number given here
# is something else than htop for instance shows, which
# is 1024 (bytes) = 1K.
# 176G would use 186 GB of RAM. Even so the java man
# page seems to agree with htop.
-Xmx175G
